## How it works
```bash
the camera can be controlled using mouse controls for panning and zooming. UPon fetching nft's, the nft would be displayed on the cube.
```
## Challenges faced
```bash
Issues while importing unity thirdweb sdk and hence resorted to creating my own game development environment using React three-fiber and React-drei for establishing 3d canvas context.
Primary issue occurred when i tried to use unity and thirdweb and realised that relying on it would be wasting  time.

I also learned how i would convert base 64 encoded string from the onchain nft to a blob in a broswer enviroment compared to using a node.js enviroment  (to create a custom nft texture for the 3d cube)
Learning to integrate nfts into 3d models

```
